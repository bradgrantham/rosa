# TRS-80 Model III emulator

This is a simple emulator for a TRS-80 Model III. It supports video, keyboard,
and booting into ROM Basic. It does not support floppy diskette or cassette.
You'll need to find a Model III ROM and put it in Rosa's root directory (see
the `--root-dir` flag) and call it `model3.rom`.

To press the Break key, use Esc. To press the Clear key, use backslash.
To switch to lower case (Shift-zero in the original), use underscore.
